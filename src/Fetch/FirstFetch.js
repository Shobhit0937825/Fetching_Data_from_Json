          "v_model_description":"<h2>Tesla Model 3 Overview</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla Model 3 is the company&#39;s most affordable vehicle on the international market. The Model 3 has the appearance of a sports car but the dimensions of a sedan. The EV has a large battery, a good range of about 500 kilometres, and a slew of amenities. It will most likely arrive in India as a CBU, but Tesla is in talks with the Indian government to obtain tax benefits similar to those offered to other EVs in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Tesla Model 3: Battery Specifications</strong><br />\r\nThe Model 3 is expected to come with two battery packs: 50 kWh and 75 kWh. On a full charge, the smaller battery can give a range of 350 kilometres and can accelerate from a standstill to 100 kilometres per hour in 5.6 seconds. The top speed is 210 kilometres per hour. The battery can be charged to 210km range in around 30 minutes with a supercharger added. The larger 75kWh battery pack can travel 500 kilometres on a single charge, accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour in 5.1 seconds, and reach a top speed of 225 kilometres per hour. In terms of charging time, Tesla Superchargers can charge the Model 3&#39;s battery to the point where it can travel 281 kilometres in 15 minutes. A regular charging point, on the other hand, will take roughly 20 hours to fully charge the battery, whereas a 7 kW charger will take around 8.5 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Tesla Model 3: Design and Features</strong><br />\r\nThe Model 3&#39;s exterior features sweptback LED headlamps and tail lights. The international model has an all-glass top and a comparable rear design to its siblings. The car will have the same 18-inch alloy wheels as the global spec variant, as well as an A-pillar mounted ORVM, rear-reflectors, and an optional body kit.<br />\r\nAt the interior, the Tesla Model 3 features a big 15.4-inch touchscreen panel&nbsp; in the dashboard that serves as an entertainment system, doubles as an instrument console, as an nav-sat control, air-con control and provides access to all car-related functions; all-black leather seating, a panoramic sunroof, and wooden dashboard accents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Tesla Model 3: Price and Launch</strong><br />\r\nThe launch of Tesla Model 3 is expected to be around end of 2022. Tesla will launch the first set of automobiles as CBUs, and the brand is pushing the Indian government for tax breaks on completely imported electric vehicles. The company is unlikely to bring the vehicles in until the issue is resolved. The price of Tesla Model 3 will be higher due to the CBU route. The Tesla Model 3 starts around $38,000 in the United States, which is similar to Rs. 27.88 lakh in India. The Model 3 is expected to cost round Rs 60 lakh to Rs 75 lakh in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

          "v_model_description":"<p><strong>Last Updated On 6th Jun&#39;22:&nbsp;</strong>Volkswagen ID 3 has been teased a couple of times, however, the India-spec launch is still unannounced. It is showcased at several Auto Expo Marts and features a futuristic design with a conventional approach. Once launched, the ID.3 will pitch against the <a href=\"https://www.91wheels.com/cars/mg/zs-ev\">MG ZS EV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.91wheels.com/cars/hyundai/kona-electric\">Hyundai Kona</a> and <a href=\"https://www.91wheels.com/cars/tata/nexon-ev-max\">Tata Nexon EV Max</a>. The carmaker has also brought in the ID.3.X version in the international market. Its not only lighter than the ID.3 but also get more features than it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Volkswagen ID 3 Battery Capacity:&nbsp;</strong>The ID.3 is available in three battery capacities &ndash; 45kWh, 58 kWh and 77kWh. The range for all three are 330 km, 420 km and 550 km respectively. We believe that to keep the costs low, VW will bring in the lower-spec model but if they were to ring in the ID.3 via the CBU route then they can launch the EV with the 77kWh battery pack. The costs will significantly rise then and it&rsquo;ll rival with <a href=\"https://www.91wheels.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.91wheels.com/cars/kia/ev6\">Kia EV6</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Volkswagen ID 3 Features:&nbsp;</strong>It gets a large touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control, matrix LED headlights, Beats sound system, adjustable headrests for the rear passengers and others.&nbsp;</p>",

          "v_model_description":"<p><strong>Last Updated: 1st Jun&#39;22</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mahindra XUV 300 Electric Launch:&nbsp;</strong>Mahindra has now confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.91wheels.com/news/mahindra-xuv-300-electric-to-make-debut-in-early-2023-details/\">the XUV300 EV wil be launched by early 2023</a>, most probably at the 2023 Auto Expo. The car was showcased first at the 2020 Auto Expo and will rival the Tata Nexon EV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mahindra XUV 300 Electric Overview</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe eXUV 300 was showcased at the 2020 India Auto Expo as a concept vehicle. However, a heavily camouflaged model of the same was spotted being tested in Chennai, which is indicative of one thing its launch is nearing. The five-seater EV will compete in a segment that includes rivals like Tata Nexon EV, and the MG ZS EV. Below we have discussed some of the details of the upcoming eXUV 300 that we have observed, in both the concept vehicle and the camouflaged test module.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exterior</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall exterior silhouette design of the eXUV 300 is not a huge leap from its petrol counterpart, the XUV 300. There can be no doubt, whatsoever, that the EV is based on the same platform as the XUV 300. The redesigned front fascia of the concept vehicle showcased a unique closed grille, flanked by futuristic-looking headlights at both ends. But the side profile of eXUV 300 looks unmistakeably its petrol counterpart, same for its rear profile as well. Mahindra might also offer the EV with blue accents, as was visible in the concept version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interior</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the exterior, the interior of the eXUV 300 is also expected to retain the same appeal found in the XUV 300. However, the EV could equip an infotainment screen larger than the 7-inch unit present in the regular model. Minor changes on the floor panel are expected to accommodate the battery pack. This means that the vehicle&#39;s weight will increase; however, ground clearance didn&rsquo;t seem to be that compromised in the concept vehicle. Aside from that, the overall cabin of the eXUV 300 will not be an evolutionary leap over its petrol counterpart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official feature list of the eXUV 300 is yet to be finalized. However, some of the possible features might include, connected car tech, sunroof, rain-sensing wiper, dual-zone auto climate control, etc. Just like its petrol counterpart, the eXUV 300 will also be high on safety, with features like multiple airbags, cornering brake control, Anti-Brake System with Electronic Brake Distribution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Engine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being an EV, the Mahindra eXUV 300 will be powered by an almost 130 bhp electric motor that will power the front wheels. The motor is expected to draw its power from a 40 kWh battery pack, which is capable of delivering a range of 300 km on a single charge. The exact technical specifications are yet to be confirmed. But Mahindra has confirmed the electric SUV will be the first of its kind to feature battery cells developed exclusively for Indian applications by LG Chem, a Korean battery manufacturer. Mahindra has collaborated with the company to develop advanced lithium-ion battery technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Launch and Price</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mahindra and Mahindra recently announced that they are looking to launch the eXUV 300 in quarter-3 or quarter-4 of FY-23. Expect the electric SUV to be priced from Rs. 15 lakh (ex-showroom) onwards.&nbsp;</p>",
